        <h1>Understanding Investment: A Guide to Growing Your Wealth</h1>
        <p>Investing is a cornerstone of financial planning that enables individuals to build wealth over time. It transcends simple saving by actively growing your money through returns generated by various assets. Whether you are planning for retirement, buying a home, or achieving financial independence, understanding investment fundamentals is key to making informed decisions.</p>

        <h2>What is Investment?</h2>
        <p>Investment involves allocating resources, typically money, into various financial instruments, property, or ventures with the expectation of earning a profit or generating income over time. Unlike saving—which focuses on preserving money for future use in a low-risk environment like a savings account—investment aims to grow wealth by taking calculated risks.</p>

        <h3>Key Objectives of Investment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth Creation:</strong> To multiply money over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Security:</strong> To prepare for unforeseen expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Income:</strong> To earn money without active work.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation Hedge:</strong> To ensure the value of your money doesn’t erode over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Achieving Goals:</strong> Such as retirement, home purchase, or funding education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Investing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth Accumulation:</strong> Through compounding returns, your initial investment grows exponentially over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection Against Inflation:</strong> Investments like stocks, real estate, and commodities often outpace inflation, preserving your wealth.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Income:</strong> Investments like dividend-paying stocks, bonds, or rental properties generate regular income streams.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Certain investment vehicles offer tax advantages, reducing your overall tax liability.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Security and Independence:</strong> A diversified investment portfolio can act as a financial safety net during emergencies and pave the way to financial independence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
        <div class="investment-section">
            <h3>1. Stocks</h3>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='stocks.jpeg') }}" alt="Stocks">
            <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. Investors earn through capital appreciation (price increase) and dividends.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Buying 10 shares of a company at $50 each. If the price rises to $70, your investment grows from $500 to $700.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-section">
            <h3>2. Fixed Deposits</h3>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='fd.jpeg') }}" alt="Bonds">
            <p>A fixed deposit (FD) is a tenured deposit account provided by banks or non-bank financial institutions which provides investors a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not require the creation of a separate account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-section">
            <h3>3. Mutual Funds</h3>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='mutualfunds.png') }}" alt="Mutual Funds">
            <p>Mutual funds pool money from many investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities, managed by professionals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A balanced mutual fund invests 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, offering both growth and stability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-section">

            <p>Investing in physical property like residential or commercial buildings for rental income or capital appreciation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Buying a house for $200,000 and selling it for $300,000 after 10 years, while also earning monthly rental income.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <p>Commodities include tangible assets like gold, silver, oil, or agricultural products.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Investing in gold during economic downturns as it often retains value when other assets decline.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-section">
            <h3>6. Cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='crypto.jpeg') }}" alt="Cryptocurrencies">
            <p>Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on blockchain technology and are highly speculative investments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Buying Bitcoin at $20,000 and selling at $30,000 for a 50% profit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
